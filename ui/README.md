# UI Components

This directory contains UI components for Deadbolt AI:

- **alerts.py**: Manages UI alerts and system tray functionality

The UI components are currently placeholders for future implementation. In upcoming versions, these will provide:

1. System tray icon for easy access to Deadbolt AI
2. Alert dialogs for security notifications
3. Configuration interface
4. Log viewer

The UI will be implemented using Tkinter to maintain minimal dependencies.
